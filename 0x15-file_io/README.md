The "0x15. C - File I/O" project focuses on file input/output (I/O) operations in C. It covers various tasks such as reading files, creating files, appending text to files, and working with ELF headers.

The learning objectives of this project include:

Developing proficiency in searching for information online.
Understanding file operations such as creating, opening, closing, reading, and writing files.
Familiarity with file descriptors and their purpose.
Recognizing the standard file descriptors and their POSIX names.
Utilizing system calls like open, close, read, and write for I/O operations.
Understanding and using flags such as O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR.
Setting file permissions while creating files using the open system call.
Distinguishing between functions and system calls.
The project requirements include using the specified editors (vi, vim, emacs) and compiling the code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific flags. The code should follow the Betty style, have a README.md file, and adhere to certain restrictions (e.g., limited library functions, no global variables, specific header files).

The project consists of several tasks, each with its own requirements. Here's a brief summary of each task:

read_textfile: Write a function to read a text file and print its contents to the standard output.
create_file: Implement a function to create a file and write text content into it.
append_text_to_file: Develop a function to append text at the end of an existing file.
cp: Create a program that copies the content of one file to another.
elf_header (Advanced): Build a program to display the information in the ELF header of an ELF file.
Completing these tasks will enhance your understanding of file I/O operations, system calls, and working with files in C programming.
