Function Pointers
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of function pointers. Each program focuses on a specific functionality and provides a clear example of how function pointers can be utilized in different scenarios.

List of Programs
Print Name: Demonstrates the usage of a function pointer to print a name. The program includes two functions: print_name_as_is and print_name_uppercase, which print the name as it is and in uppercase, respectively.

Array Iterator: Illustrates how to use a function pointer to execute a function on each element of an array. The program includes two functions: print_elem and print_elem_hex, which print the elements of the array and their hexadecimal values, respectively.

Integer Index: Implements a function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer for comparison. The program includes three functions: is_98, is_strictly_positive, and abs_is_98, which perform different comparison operations.

Calculator: A program that performs simple arithmetic operations based on command-line input. The program includes various files: 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, and 3-calc.h. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.

Main Opcodes: A program that prints the opcodes of its own main function. The program takes the number of bytes as a command-line argument and outputs the corresponding opcodes in hexadecimal format.
