Project Name: 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

This project is about manipulating bits and using bitwise operators in the C programming language. It is part of the curriculum in the low-level programming track. The project consists of several tasks, and the following are the specific requirements and instructions:

General
Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compile files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files should end with a new line
Include a README.md file at the root of the folder of the project
Use the Betty style
Do not use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc. is forbidden.
You are allowed to use _putchar
The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in a header file called main.h
All header files should be include guarded
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
How to look for the right source of information without too much help
How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
Tasks
There are two mandatory tasks:
Task 0: Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
Task 1: Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Quiz Questions
The project also includes a quiz section.

Disclaimer
The project requires coming up with solutions for the tasks on your own. Plagiarism in any form is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
